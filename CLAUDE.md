#### Core Architecture:

```javascript
// 3D Sphere Particle System with Orbital Mechanics
const particleGroup = new THREE.Group();
const particlesArray = [];
const originalPositions = [];

// Individual sphere creation with orbital properties
for (let i = 0; i < particleConfig.count; i++) {
  const sphereGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(
    Math.random() * 0.3 + 0.1, // Random radius 0.1-0.4
    isMobile ? 6 : 8, // Optimized segments
    isMobile ? 4 : 6
  );

  // Orbital properties for each particle
  const orbitRadius = Math.random() * 15 + 8;
  const orbitSpeed = Math.random() * 0.003 + 0.001; // Slow speeds
  const orbitAngle = Math.random() * Math.PI * 2;
}
```

#### Technical Implementation:

1. **3D Sphere Geometry**: Individual THREE.SphereGeometry instances for realistic depth
2. **Orbital System**: Horizontal circular motion in XY plane facing user
3. **Mouse Interaction**: Dispersion-only effect with corrected orientation
4. **Color Management**: Stable 50/50 purple/blue distribution
5. **Performance Optimization**: Mobile-adaptive geometry and particle count
6. **Lighting System**: Three-point lighting setup preserving particle colors

```javascript
// Orbital animation with mouse dispersion
userData.currentAngle += userData.orbitSpeed;
const baseX = Math.cos(userData.currentAngle) * userData.orbitRadius;
const baseY = Math.sin(userData.currentAngle) * userData.orbitRadius;

// Mouse dispersion effect
if (distance3D < particleConfig.mouseInfluence) {
  const disperseForce =
    (particleConfig.mouseInfluence - distance3D) /
    particleConfig.mouseInfluence;
  finalX += (dx / distance3D) * disperseForce * 8;
  finalY += (dy / distance3D) * disperseForce * 8;
}
```

#### Evolution Process:

1. **Initial 2D Points**: Started with basic THREE.Points particle system
2. **3D Sphere Conversion**: Replaced with individual sphere geometries
3. **Particle Recycling**: Implemented boundary management to prevent disappearing

### 10. Magic Scroll System - ProjectsSection (CRITICAL COMPONENT)

**⚠️ WARNING: NEVER REMOVE OR SIMPLIFY - Core portfolio functionality**

The ProjectsSection component implements a sophisticated pinned scroll system with Apple-style magnetic zones that is the centerpiece of the portfolio experience. This system creates a cinematic presentation where projects appear, stick for extended viewing, then disappear in phases as the user scrolls.

#### Core Architecture:

```javascript
// Phase-based scroll system with magnetic zones
const totalPhases = 1 + projects.length; // Header + each project
const totalHeight = totalPhases * 1.8 * window.innerHeight; // Extended for magnetic zones

ScrollTrigger.create({
  trigger: section,
  start: 'top top',
  end: `+=${totalHeight}`,
  pin: true,
  pinSpacing: true,
  scrub: 1,
  onUpdate: (self) => {
    const progress = self.progress;
    const phaseProgress = progress * totalPhases;
    const currentPhase = Math.floor(phaseProgress);
    // Complex phase-based animations...
  },
});
```

#### Animation Phases:

1. **Phase 0**: Title appears, then fades up with dramatic distance calculation
2. **Phase 1-N**: Each project appears in center, then moves up and disappears
3. **Final Phase**: Last project stays visible

#### Key Features:

- **Viewport-based calculations**: Dynamic distances based on window.innerHeight
- **Navbar-aware positioning**: Calculates navbar height + buffer for smooth transitions
- **Progressive reveal**: Projects appear individually with fade + movement
- **Responsive design**: Mobile adaptations maintain functionality
