## Animation System (GSAP)

### Core Animations
```javascript
// Hero entrance timeline
const heroTl = gsap.timeline();
heroTl
  .fromTo('.hero-greeting', {y: 50, opacity: 0}, {y: 0, opacity: 1, duration: 1})
  .fromTo('.hero-name', {y: 50, opacity: 0, scale: 0.9}, {y: 0, opacity: 1, scale: 1, duration: 1.2})
  .fromTo('.typewriter-text', {y: 30, opacity: 0}, {y: 0, opacity: 1, duration: 0.8})
  .fromTo('.hero-description', {y: 30, opacity: 0}, {y: 0, opacity: 1, duration: 1});
```

### ScrollTrigger Configuration
- **Projects**: Trigger at 85% viewport, stagger 0.2s
- **Timeline**: Line animation at 75%, items at 65%
- **Footer**: Entrance at 90% viewport
- **Parallax**: Background movement on desktop only

### Performance Optimizations
- Mobile detection to disable heavy animations
- Reduced motion accessibility support
- Scroll refresh on initialization
- Cleanup on component unmount

## Styling Approach

### CSS Variables (Dark Theme)
```css
--primary-bg: #0a0a0a;
--secondary-bg: #1a1a1a;  
--accent-color: #3b82f6;
--text-primary: #ffffff;
--text-secondary: #a1a1aa;
```

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile First**: Base styles for mobile, then desktop enhancements
- **Breakpoints**: 768px for tablet/desktop transitions
- **Flexible Grid**: CSS Grid with auto-fit for project cards
- **Typography**: Fluid sizing with clamp() functions

### Animation Classes
- `.typewriter-cursor`: Blinking cursor with CSS animations
- `.particle`: Floating background elements with random positioning
- `.gradient-bg`: Animated gradient background
- `.timeline-line`: SVG-like line animation with scaleY transform

## Development History & Key Fixes

### 1. Initial Setup (Session 1)
- Created complete portfolio structure
- Implemented GSAP animations and ScrollTrigger
- Set up modular data architecture
- Responsive design implementation

### 2. Navigation & Scroll Issues (Session 2)
**Problem**: Scroll positioning had gaps when navigating to sections
**Solution**: Adjusted navbar height calculation from `offsetHeight + 10` to just `offsetHeight`, then user manually set to 80px

**Problem**: Navbar too opaque, hiding background animations
**Solution**: Changed background from `rgba(10, 10, 10, 0.8)` to `rgba(10, 10, 10, 0.2)`

### 3. Particle Animation Fix (Session 2)
**Problem**: Particles only visible on left side of screen
**Solution**: Improved positioning logic to distribute all 50 particles across full viewport width

### 4. Code Organization (Session 3)
- Separated projects data into `src/data/projects.js`
- Separated experiences data into `src/data/experiences.js`
- Improved maintainability and content management

### 5. Typewriter Effect Implementation (Session 4)
**Initial Attempt**: Custom React hook with complex state management
**Problem**: Hook got stuck on "Full Stack Developer", wouldn't cycle through other phrases
**Multiple Fix Attempts**: Rewrote state transition logic several times
**Final Solution**: Replaced custom hook with `typewriter-effect` library

### 6. Library Implementation (Session 5)
- Installed `typewriter-effect` library
- Removed 70+ lines of custom typewriter code
- Configured proper timing: 80ms typing, 30ms deleting, 3000ms pause
- Fixed timing issues where phrases displayed partially

### 7. Internationalization (Session 6)
**Complete Translation**: Converted entire site from Spanish to English
- Navigation: "Inicio" → "Home", "Proyectos" → "Projects", etc.
- Hero: "Creando experiencias digitales..." → "Creating innovative digital experiences..."
- Sections: "Proyectos Destacados" → "Featured Projects"
- Footer: "¡Trabajemos juntos!" → "Let's work together!"
- Data files: All project descriptions and experience details translated

### 8. Magic Scroll System - ProjectsSection (CRITICAL COMPONENT)
**⚠️ WARNING: NEVER REMOVE OR SIMPLIFY - Core portfolio functionality**

The ProjectsSection component implements a sophisticated pinned scroll system with Apple-style magnetic zones that is the centerpiece of the portfolio experience. This system creates a cinematic presentation where projects appear, stick for extended viewing, then disappear in phases as the user scrolls.

#### Core Architecture:
```javascript
// Phase-based scroll system with magnetic zones
const totalPhases = 1 + projects.length; // Header + each project
const totalHeight = totalPhases * 1.8 * window.innerHeight; // Extended for magnetic zones

ScrollTrigger.create({
  trigger: section,
  start: 'top top',
  end: `+=${totalHeight}`,
  pin: true,
  pinSpacing: true,
  scrub: 1,
  onUpdate: (self) => {
    const progress = self.progress;
    const phaseProgress = progress * totalPhases;
    const currentPhase = Math.floor(phaseProgress);
    // Complex phase-based animations...
  }
});
```

#### Animation Phases:
1. **Phase 0**: Title appears, then fades up with dramatic distance calculation
2. **Phase 1-N**: Each project appears in center, then moves up and disappears
3. **Final Phase**: Last project stays visible

#### Key Features:
- **Viewport-based calculations**: Dynamic distances based on window.innerHeight
- **Navbar-aware positioning**: Calculates navbar height + buffer for smooth transitions
- **Progressive reveal**: Projects appear individually with fade + movement
- **Responsive design**: Mobile adaptations maintain functionality
- **Performance optimized**: Uses GSAP for 60fps animations

#### Critical Implementation Details:
- Uses `pinSpacing: true` for proper scroll behavior
- `scrub: 1` for smooth scroll-linked animations
- Dynamic `titleMaxDistance` calculation prevents viewport overflow
- Phase progress mapping with `Math.floor()` for discrete transitions
- Easing functions: `power2.out` for exits, `power3.out` for entrances

#### Files Involved:
- `src/components/ProjectsSection.jsx` (257 lines) - Main component logic
- `src/styles/ProjectsSection.css` (380 lines) - Specialized styling
- Integrated into Portfolio.jsx at line 407

This system took multiple sessions to perfect and represents the most complex animation system in the portfolio. Any modifications should be done with extreme caution and thorough testing.

## Technical Considerations

### Performance

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server on localhost:5173

# Production
npm run build        # Build for production in dist/
npm run preview      # Preview production build

# Code Quality
npm run lint         # Run ESLint on codebase
```

## Key Takeaways for Future Development

1. **Custom vs Library**: The typewriter effect experience showed that sometimes using a well-tested library is better than custom implementation
2. **Animation Performance**: GSAP provides excellent performance but requires careful mobile optimization
3. **Modular Data**: Separating data from components makes content updates much easier
4. **Accessibility**: Always consider `prefers-reduced-motion` and provide fallbacks
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement works best
6. **Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns improves maintainability
